Andrea Dichiara's Content Management System and ecommerce site.

The ecommerce site is simple accessed by entering the index.php file. Once in there there are four menus on the top right corner. You have the home, about, catalog, and contact.

Home is just a link to the home page.
About has some general information about Andrea DiChiara.
Catalog displays all of the items that currently reside on the database.
Contact is going to be used to send a message to Andrea, but it has not been implemented yet.

In the footer of the website, there is a link to access the content management system.

Find the instructions on how to operate it below:

This content management system has been created to allow you, the administrator, to manipulate the information displayed on the main website andreadichiara.com. 
You will find a list of tools in the navigation list menu on the top right. 

Below, we will give a quick overview of each of the functions

Add an Item: This function will give you the opportunity to add an item to the database. You will need to fill up a simple form and upload an image which will be stored in the database and displayed on the main site.

View Items: This function will display all of the items currently in the database with an overview of information.

Update an Item: This function allows you to modify existing items in the database. You need to know the item serial number in order to use this function.

Delete an Item: This function lets you delete an item from the database. All you need to know is just the serial number, fill up a small form, and that's it! Record of that item will be gone!

This content management system is still in its Beta stages, which means that more features will be added in the future.
